# control-and-robotics-learning
8-week self-directed study in control systems, simulation, and robotics.

Introduction
This repository documents my 8-weeks self-directed study in control systems,
simulation, and robotics-oriented system thinking.
This focus is on modeling, simulation, and controller design using Python and MATLAB.

Learning Goals:
- Build intuition for dynamic systems via simulation
- Implement numerical solvers and control algorithms from scratch 
- Connect mathematical models to physical behavior
- Develop system-level thinking relevant to robotics and control research

Roadmap:
- Weeks 1-2: Python-based simulation of dynamic systems
- Week 3: MATLAB and control toolbox fundamentals
- Week 4: Control concepts (stability, feedback, PID)
- Week 5: Robotics and system-level thinking
- Weeks 6-7: Mini-project integrating modeling + control
- Week 8: Documentation, reflection, and preparation fo research discussions

Highlighted Project:
- Closed-loop control of a dynamic system (see week06_07_final_project)
- Includes modeling, controller design, and simulation analysis

This repository is intended to demonstrate my problem-solving process,
coding style, and readiness for research-oriented learning.
