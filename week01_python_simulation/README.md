# Week 1: Python Simulation of Dynamic Systems

Focus:
- Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs)
- Numerical integration
- Time-domain simulation

Goals:
- Translate mathematical models into code
- Observe how system states evolve over time
- Build intuition for dynamic behavior

Tools:
- Python
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
