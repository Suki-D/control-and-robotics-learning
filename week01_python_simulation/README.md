# Week 1: Python Simulation of Dynamic Systems

Focus:
- Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs)
- Numerical integration
- Time-domain simulation

Goals:
- Translate mathematical models into code
- Observe how system states evolve over time
- Build intuition for dynamic behavior

Tools:
- Python
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

### Day 1: First ODE Simulation

Implemented a simple first-order ODE dx/dt = -x and simulated it
using Euler integration.

This experiment helped build intuition for how system state evolves
over time and how numerical integration approximates continuous dynamics.

### Day 2: Numerical Stability and Time Step Effects

Explored how the Euler method behaves with larger time steps.
Observed that even a stable continuous-time system can exhibit
unstable or unrealistic behavior when simulated with an overly
large step size.

This experiment highlighted the importance of numerical stability
in simulation-based analysis.
